# Monty Mayhem 
The most adorable, strategic survival game awaits you! Build and survive as you face swarms of mushroom-eating beetles that emerge at night. Work hard to defend your base, expand across the island, and outplay these creatures to reign victorious in this exciting game of resource management and survival.

The commit tagged [here](https://github.com/bncmn/monty-mayhem-game/releases/tag/nyns-submission-candidate) is the version of the game submitted to the [New Year, New Skills Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/new-year-new-skills-game-jam) hosted by Bitter Sails. This game is now a **potential work-in-progress**, and we are hoping to continue working on the game after the event has concluded. 

## Game Controls and Mechanics
The following are handled through mouse input (LMB):
* Player movement
* Attack
* Interact with objects

Survive as long as you can from enemies by clicking on them to kill, and building walls for defense. Collect resources by clicking on trees and rocks to then craft tools. You can craft by dragging those resources into the base, and crafting through the menu.

## Development Specifics
This game was made using [Godot 4.2.1](https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-4-2-1/).
